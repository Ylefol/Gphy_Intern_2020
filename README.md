GPHY_Intern_2020

A repository to showcase the pipeline done during the Gphy internship of 2020

The elements provided in this repository are exclusively for visualization purposes. The data files used to create the results are too large to be uploaded to a public repository such as this.

The jupyter notebook has been 'run' already and will contain the results provided that the user does not reset the kernel.
The all_utils_jup.py contains all the functions used within the pipeline as well as a few other functions which were created but not implemented in the pipeline. Each function has the required documentation in PyDoc format.
